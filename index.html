<h1>Aaron Swartz Hackathon</h1>
Inspired by the work he did and the people he touched, we are organizing recurring hackathons at locations all over the world in memory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a>. The next set will be synchronized on the weekend of November 8-10, 2013. The event will bring together the varied communities that Aaron touched to figure out how the important problems of the world connect, and to share the load of working on those problems. 
The November 8-10 hackathon series is being coordinated on <a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Worldwide_Aaron_Swartz_Memorial_Hackathon_Series">this wiki page</a>.

<h1>The Berlin Event</h1>

<ul><li><a href="https://securedrop.hackpad.com/Report-Back-from-Berlin-Hackathon-Friday-TJPriWiRfn0">Report back after Day 1</a></li>
</ul>

To give us all plenty of Hacking time... in addition to the first session on the Friday, participants are encouraged to come back and hangout at the c-base over the weekend, hours as follows:
<li>Saturday: from 11 am till late.</li>
<li>Sunday: from 11 am till late. Note the final presentations / round-up will be at 12 noon on Sunday.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Structure of the event</h2>
<ul>
<li>
In advance at each location, (at least) one presenter is chosen to "pitch" what they consider a vital project. This project should be eminently hackable -- the presenter or another volunteer who knows the project well should be prepared to help interested parties get involved, at many skill levels.</li>

<li>The event starts like a hybrid (un-)conference, with introductions and short presentations. The pre-announced presenter(s) do these presentations, and during the introductions people can offer or request talks, which are added as time permits on the spot. Total presentation time should be ~1.5-2hrs.</li>

<li>Presentations are recorded and immediately posted online (or streamed), for remote participants or people at other hackathons to see.</li>

<li>Then there's open time to work.</li>

<li>Finally, at the end of the event, there are 1.5-2hrs of demonstrations of results. Anyone can sign up on the site with info about project status to get a demo slot.</li>

<li>Demos are also recorded and posted online, cross-referenced with individuals and projects.</li>

<h2>Projects</h2>
